Introduction
============

ZPyWallet is a powerful Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet backend designed for creating wallet software.
It provides a secure and convenient way to manage cryptographic keys, generate addresses, and perform wallet-related operations.
Whether you are building a cryptocurrency wallet application, integrating wallet functionality into an existing project, or
developing blockchain-related services, ZPyWallet offers the essential tools and functionality to simplify your development process.

Key Features
------------
**Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallet Support:**
ZPyWallet implements the industry-standard Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet approach,
allowing you to derive an unlimited number of cryptographic keys from a single master seed.
This hierarchical structure provides enhanced key management, backup, and recovery capabilities.

**BIP32 and BIP44 Compliance:**
ZPyWallet adheres to the widely accepted BIP32, BIP44, and BIP84 standards for key derivation and wallet structure.
By following these standards, ZPyWallet ensures compatibility with other wallets and services that utilize the same specifications.

**Multi-Cryptocurrency Support:**
ZPyWallet supports a variety of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and more. It enables you to generate addresses,
sign transactions, and perform wallet operations for multiple digital assets within a unified and consistent interface.

**Blockchain Network Synchronization:**
ZPyWallet offers synchronization capabilities with third-party services, allowing you to retrieve real-time balance information,
transaction history, and other relevant data for your wallets. This feature streamlines the process of tracking wallet activity
and managing funds.

**Secure and Portable Key Storage and Management:**
ZPyWallet wallets can be exported as an encrypted, password-protected containers encoded as Base64, allowing it to be stored anywhere
such as on a filesystem, a database, or even as state data in a cloud application. The encryption algorithms can be adjusted
to fine-tune the decryption process, resisting brute-force attacks.

**Convenient APIs and Utilities:**
ZPyWallet offers a user-friendly and intuitive API for interacting with the wallet backend. It provides easy-to-use functions for
wallet creation, key derivation, address generation, transaction signing, and more. Additionally, ZPyWallet includes utilities for
mnemonic phrase generation, message signing and verification, fee estimation, and other common wallet-related tasks.
